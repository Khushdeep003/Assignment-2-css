      <p>Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain</p>
      <p>I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days</p>
      <p>She came back, she came back, she came back</p>
      <p>For me</p>
      <p>'Cause she heard my voice through the wall</p>
      <p>I've been talking away, I don't know what I'm to say</p>
      <p>I'll be singing like, "Na, na, na, na" then you say</p>
      <p>"Go on and kiss the girl"</p>
      <p>Sing it with me, "Na, na, na, na, oh, oh"</p>
      <p>This story of my life, I take her home</p>
      <p>I drive all night, just to buy her roses</p>
      <p>And they say, "This is a crazy life"</p>
      <p>But I wouldn't change it, no, I wouldn't change it</p>
      <p>And I'm just trying to make you see</p>
      <p>That everything means nothing, if I can't have you with me</p>
      <p>So come on and sing it with me, "Na, na, na, na, oh, oh"</p>
      <p>This story of my life</p>
